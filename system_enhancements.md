# System Enhancements Documentation

## 1. Handling Duplicate Documents

### Current Implementation
- The system uses ChromaDB's built-in deduplication based on document content
- Documents are identified by their content hash in the vector store
- Metadata is preserved for tracking document sources and versions

### Recommended Improvements
1. **Content-Based Deduplication**
   - Implement semantic similarity threshold (e.g., 0.95) to identify near-duplicates
   - Use document embeddings to compare similarity scores
   - Merge metadata from similar documents to preserve all context

2. **Version Control**
   - Track document versions using timestamps
   - Maintain version history in metadata
   - Allow rollback to previous versions if needed

3. **Metadata-Based Deduplication**
   - Consider source, author, and timestamp in deduplication logic
   - Implement configurable rules for different document types
   - Allow manual override for specific cases

### Technique Examples

1. **Semantic Similarity Detection**
   ```
   Document A: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"
   Document B: "A brown fox quickly jumps over a sleeping dog"
   Similarity Score: 0.92 (Considered duplicate)
   
   Document C: "The lazy dog sleeps while the fox runs"
   Similarity Score: 0.75 (Not considered duplicate)
   ```

2. **Version Control Example**
   ```
   Document: "API Documentation"
   Versions:
   - v1.0 (2024-01-01): Initial release
   - v1.1 (2024-02-01): Added authentication section
   - v1.2 (2024-03-01): Updated rate limits
   ```

3. **Metadata-Based Rules**
   ```
   Rule 1: Company Documentation
   - Source: Internal Wiki
   - Priority: High
   - Keep all versions
   
   Rule 2: User Contributions
   - Source: Community Forum
   - Priority: Medium
   - Keep only unique content
   ```

## 2. Document Prioritization

### Current Implementation
- Documents are stored with timestamps
- Basic recency-based retrieval in hybrid search

### Recommended Improvements
1. **Time-Based Weighting**
   - Implement exponential decay for document relevance scores
   - Formula: `score = base_score * e^(-λ * time_difference)`
   - Adjust λ parameter based on domain requirements

2. **Source-Based Prioritization**
   - Assign weights to different document sources
   - Consider source reliability and authority
   - Implement source-specific decay rates

3. **Content-Based Prioritization**
   - Track document usage statistics
   - Prioritize frequently accessed documents
   - Consider document quality metrics

### Technique Examples

1. **Time Decay Calculation**
   ```
   Document Age    Decay Factor (λ=0.1)    Final Score
   1 day           0.90                    0.90
   7 days          0.50                    0.50
   30 days         0.05                    0.05
   ```

2. **Source Weighting**
   ```
   Source Types:
   - Official Documentation: 1.0
   - Technical Blog: 0.8
   - Community Forum: 0.6
   - User Comments: 0.4
   ```

3. **Usage-Based Prioritization**
   ```
   Document: "Authentication Guide"
   - Views: 1000
   - Helpful Votes: 95%
   - Average Time Spent: 5 minutes
   Priority Score: 0.95
   ```

## 3. System Performance Monitoring

### Current Implementation
- Basic logging of operations
- Error tracking and reporting

### Recommended Improvements
1. **Response Quality Metrics**
   - Implement ROUGE/L/BERT scores for response evaluation
   - Track answer relevance and completeness
   - Monitor response generation time

2. **System Behavior Tracking**
   - Log query patterns and user interactions
   - Track document retrieval effectiveness
   - Monitor cache hit rates and response times

3. **Performance Metrics**
   - Response latency tracking
   - Resource utilization monitoring
   - Error rate and type analysis

### Technique Examples

1. **Response Quality Assessment**
   ```
   Query: "How to implement OAuth2?"
   
   Quality Metrics:
   - Relevance Score: 0.85
   - Completeness: 0.90
   - Accuracy: 0.95
   - Response Time: 1.2s
   ```

2. **User Interaction Patterns**
   ```
   Common Query Patterns:
   - Authentication (30%)
   - API Usage (25%)
   - Error Handling (20%)
   - Best Practices (15%)
   - Other (10%)
   ```

3. **System Performance Metrics**
   ```
   Peak Hours (2-4 PM):
   - Average Response Time: 1.5s
   - CPU Usage: 65%
   - Memory Usage: 3.2GB
   - Cache Hit Rate: 80%
   
   Off-Peak Hours (2-4 AM):
   - Average Response Time: 0.8s
   - CPU Usage: 30%
   - Memory Usage: 1.8GB
   - Cache Hit Rate: 60%
   ```

4. **Error Tracking**
   ```
